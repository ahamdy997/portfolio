    <h2>Project Title: Weather Forecast Application</h2>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      The Weather Forecast Application is a user-friendly and visually appealing
      web application that provides users with real-time weather information,
      forecasts, and location-based weather updates. As a frontend developer,
      this project highlights my expertise in creating interactive and
      informative user interfaces for weather-related applications.

      <h3>Key Features:</h3>
      <li>
        <strong>Location-Based Weather Data:</strong> The application fetches
        location data and presents users with accurate, up-to-date weather
        information for their current location.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Daily and Hourly Forecasts:</strong> Users can access detailed
        weather forecasts, including hourly and daily weather conditions,
        temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation forecasts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Search Functionality: </strong> The application allows users to
        search for weather information in other locations by entering city names
        or zip codes, providing a versatile user experience.
