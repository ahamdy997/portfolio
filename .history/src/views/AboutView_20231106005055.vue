    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Ahmed Hamdy, a frontend web developer specializing in Vue.js.
      I'm on a mission to create delightful and user-centric web experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey into the world of web development began with a fascination for
      crafting interactive and visually appealing websites. During my studies, I
      discovered Vue.js and was instantly captivated by its simplicity and power
      in building dynamic user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I love most about web development is the ability to bring ideas to
      life through code. I strive for clean, efficient, and maintainable code to
      ensure that every project I work on is not only visually striking but also
      performs flawlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in
      frontend development. When I'm not coding, you can find me sketching
      design ideas or exploring new technologies to enhance my skill set.
